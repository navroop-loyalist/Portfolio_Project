Hi there viewers,

To make things easier for you, i have divided my project into two parts.

In the Part 1, I have done some basic part of my project, from creating a database, importing my csv file using mongoimport to deleting and updating data. 
Overall, this part 1 has marked the completion of first 12 steps that were assigned to us by our professor.

In part 2, things were different as first i had to create a excel file named as workload, then i checked their execution stats, added indexes and again checked their execution stats, and much more. 
Overall, this part was hard but not impossible. So, there it is my whole Portfolio Project in fornt of you.

Along with that i have also attached a Quality Control ReadmeFile so that, a user can understand the basics of what quality control actually is in Manufacturing.

Hope you like it.
